# Weather-app

A simple weather application built using Python's Tkinter library that allows users to check the current weather and 4-day forecast for a specified city. The app fetches real-time weather data from the WeatherAPI, displaying temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more. Each day's forecast includes an icon representing the weather condition.
